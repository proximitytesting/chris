Some UX pointers:
1. We should always know what percentage of customers are using what email client. Because if the majority can’t view kinetic functionality, we’ve wasted everyone’s time and the clients money. A big watch-out is gmail!
2. We need to factor in an extended period of time for build and test. As we are adding functionality that requires more QA and all kinetic emails WILL require a fallback version for customers who cannot view kinetic.
3. Just because we can, doesn’t mean we should (does it aid KPIs?)
4. Mobile versions should be looked at first. That’s where all the challenges will be.
5. And finally... MAKE IT USEABLE PEOPLE!
